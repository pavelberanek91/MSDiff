Simple application that calculates Mean-Squared Displacement and Diffusion coefficient from traject .xyz file

This application was created for VIMMP (VIrtual Materials MarketPlace) project under the supervision of Dr. Martin LÃ­sal from Institute of Chemical Process Fundamentals of Academy of Science Czech Republic.

Application is create in python3 language with QT5, Matplolib, Scipy, Numpy libraries. Currently the application is slowed in comparision to equivalent application in Fortran90 language without GUI. A numerical optimization with numpy/cython and object oriented implementation is need in future contributions.

Feel free to use this app or contact the author (pavelberanek91@gmail.com) ... enjoy :)
